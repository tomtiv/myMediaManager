# myMediaManager
Everyone likes to name their media files to their own liking, I found that this made sorting and managing my media files a problem. 
This application removes common terms like "you tube", "official" or "music video" from the title or track numbers from mp3's. 
It uses a text file for terms to be removed and RegEx's for anything  else that is required.  
Both of these can be modified by the user to custom how the like their media managed.
